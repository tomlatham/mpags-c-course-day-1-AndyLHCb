# mpags-cipher
A simple command line tool for encrypting/decrypting text using classical ciphers

We are attempting to make a cipher, using caeser; playfair and vigenere ciphers. Unfortunately this is cipher in the sense of scrambling words instead of cypher in the sense of a cool rap song.

This is being implimented in C++11 and a little bit C++14.
